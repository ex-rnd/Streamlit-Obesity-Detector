# 🫃🏻 Obesity Detector 🔍

A **Streamlit web app** that predicts the obesity level of a person using a trained **Deep Learning model**.  
This project leverages personal health metrics (age, gender, height, weight, BMI, and physical activity level) to estimate whether an individual is **Normal Weight, Underweight, Overweight, or Obese**, providing clear results and visual feedback.

## ✨ Features
- 📊 Interactive UI built with **Streamlit**
- 🧠 Deep Learning model trained on **obesity dataset**
- 🔍 Prediction outputs:
  - **Normal Weight / Underweight / Overweight / Obese**
  - **Visual emoji feedback**
  - **Confidence from model prediction**
- 📈 TensorFlow/Keras-based classification
- 🧾 Input summary for transparency
- 🛡️ Educational tool (not a substitute for medical advice)
